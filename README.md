# Personal-shift-database-app
Personal database app for keeping track of my worked and scheduled shifts including an android app and Google calendar scheduler
The app (for now) consists of 4 files:<br>
1a - main.py -> This is the main file, where the mobile app with GUI will be created (WIP)<br>
1b - main.kv -> File including all the kivy styling for the GUI in main.py<br>
2 - hoursDB.py -> This is the file that all of the database magical functions call home<br>
3 - calendarScheduler.py -> This is the home of all functions regarding scheduling the shifts in my Google calendar (TODO)
